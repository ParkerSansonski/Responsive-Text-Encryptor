# Responsive Text Encryptor

Welcome to the repository of the **Responsive Text Encryptor** Project! In this project, we have created an online tool that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text securely. The application is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers.

## Features

- **Secure Encryption:** We use robust encryption algorithms to ensure that your messages are protected and not accessible to unauthorized individuals.

- **Decryption:** In addition to encrypting messages, our tool also enables you to decrypt them when needed, as long as you have the corresponding decryption key.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** We have designed an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface. Simply input your message and the encryption key, and the application will take care of the rest.

- **Responsive Design:** Our application is designed to be accessible on any device. Whether you're on your desktop computer, tablet, or mobile phone, you can use the tool seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** We have created the basic structure of the page using semantic HTML, making it easy to understand the content structure.

- **CSS:** We use CSS stylesheets to add style and design to the application. Our focus on responsive design ensures that the application looks and works great on different devices.

- **JavaScript:** The encryption and decryption functionality is implemented in JavaScript. We use reliable algorithms to ensure message security.
